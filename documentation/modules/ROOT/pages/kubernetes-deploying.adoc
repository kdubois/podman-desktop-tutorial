Deploying Pods to Kubernetes
With the local Kubernetes cluster running, you can easily deploy pods created using Podman Desktopâ€™s "Podify" feature to Kubernetes. Podman Desktop provides intuitive options to generate Kubernetes manifests and deploy pods to the cluster.

To deploy a pod to Kubernetes:

In the Pods section of Podman Desktop, select the pod you want to deploy.

Click on the Deploy to Kubernetes button from the top right corner menu.

Podman Desktop Deploy to Kubernetes
Podman Desktop will generate the necessary Kubernetes manifests for the pod and its associated resources.

Review the generated manifests and make any necessary adjustments.

Click the Deploy button to deploy the pod to the local Kubernetes cluster.

Podman Desktop will communicate with the Kubernetes API server and create the required resources in the cluster. You can monitor the deployment status and access the deployed application using the provided URL or port forwarding options.
