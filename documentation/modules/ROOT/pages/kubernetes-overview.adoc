= Kubernetes Overview and Integration with Podman Desktop
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard for container orchestration, providing a robust and scalable platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. Podman Desktop seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, enabling developers to leverage the power of Kubernetes while benefiting from the user-friendly interface and features of Podman Desktop.

== Understanding Kubernetes

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-kubernetes[Kubernetes] is an open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a declarative approach to defining and managing application components, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Key concepts in Kubernetes include:

1. *Pods*: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers that share network and storage resources.

2. *Services*: An abstraction layer that provides a stable network endpoint for accessing pods, enabling load balancing and service discovery.

3. *Deployments*: A higher-level abstraction that manages the deployment and scaling of pods, ensuring the desired state of the application is maintained.

4. *ConfigMaps and Secrets*: Objects used to store configuration data and sensitive information, respectively, which can be injected into pods as environment variables or mounted as files.

Kubernetes follows a declarative model, where users define the desired state of their application using YAML or JSON manifests. The Kubernetes control plane, consisting of components like the API server, scheduler, and controller manager, continuously works to ensure the actual state matches the desired state.

== Integrating Kubernetes with Podman Desktop

As mentioned, Podman Desktop provides a seamless integration with Kubernetes, starting from the setup of a local Kubernetes cluster to deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes. Let's take a look at how easy it is to spin up, and connect, to a Kubernetes cluster using Podman Desktop.

=== Provisioning a Kubernetes Cluster

Podman Desktop includes extensions to manage local Kubernetes clusters, enabling developers to deploy and test their applications in a Kubernetes environment without the need for external setup. The local cluster is powered by https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)] or https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube], providing a lightweight and isolated Kubernetes environment.

To start a local KinD cluster in Podman Desktop:

Navigate to the *Settings* section in Podman Desktop and select *Create new Kind cluster*.

You'll view Kind cluster settings here such as a name, port assignment (for forwarding your applications), and Kubernetes version. Choose the desired container engine provider (Podman or Docker) and click the *Create* button.

Podman Desktop will spin up the local Kubernetes cluster, and you can verify your connection from the *Pods* section of the interface, or at the bottom-left of the screen, where you can switch between different Kubernetes

=== Deploying Pods to Kubernetes

With the local Kubernetes cluster running, you can easily deploy pods created using Podman Desktop's "Podify" feature to Kubernetes. Podman Desktop provides intuitive options to generate Kubernetes manifests and deploy pods to the cluster.

To deploy a pod to Kubernetes:

1. In the *Pods* section of Podman Desktop, select the pod you want to deploy.
2. Click on the *Deploy to Kubernetes* button from the top right corner menu.

3. Podman Desktop will generate the necessary Kubernetes manifests for the pod and its associated resources.
4. Review the generated manifests and make any necessary adjustments.
5. Click the *Deploy* button to deploy the pod to the local Kubernetes cluster.

Podman Desktop will communicate with the Kubernetes API server and create the required resources in the cluster. You can monitor the deployment status and access the deployed application using the provided URL or port forwarding options.

=== Managing Kubernetes Resources

Podman Desktop provides a centralized interface for managing Kubernetes resources, including pods, services, deployments, and more. You can view and interact with Kubernetes objects directly from the Podman Desktop interface.

The *Kubernetes* section in Podman Desktop displays an overview of the cluster, including the number of nodes, pods, and services. You can drill down into specific namespaces and view the details of individual resources.

Podman Desktop also integrates with the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`), allowing you to run commands and perform advanced operations directly from the terminal within the Podman Desktop interface.

== Benefits of Kubernetes Integration

Integrating Kubernetes with Podman Desktop offers several benefits for developers:

1. *Simplified deployment*: Podman Desktop abstracts the complexities of Kubernetes, providing an intuitive interface for deploying and managing applications. Developers can focus on building their applications without needing extensive Kubernetes expertise.

2. *Local development and testing*: With the built-in local Kubernetes cluster, developers can test their applications in a Kubernetes environment without the need for external setup or infrastructure. This accelerates the development and testing process and ensures application compatibility with Kubernetes.

3. *Seamless transition to production*: By developing and testing applications using Kubernetes with Podman Desktop, developers can ensure a smooth transition to production environments. The same Kubernetes manifests and deployment patterns used locally can be applied to production clusters, reducing the risk of compatibility issues.

4. *Centralized management*: Podman Desktop provides a unified interface for managing both containers and Kubernetes resources. Developers can streamline their workflow by using a single tool for building, testing, and deploying applications, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools and interfaces.

== Next Steps

Now that you have a solid understanding of Kubernetes and its integration with Podman Desktop, you're ready to dive deeper into deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes. In the next section, we'll explore advanced topics such as configuring services, scaling deployments, and monitoring application health using Podman Desktop's Kubernetes features.

Podman Desktop's seamless integration with Kubernetes empowers developers to leverage the full potential of container orchestration while benefiting from a user-friendly and efficient development workflow. Get ready to take your containerized application development to the next level with Podman Desktop and Kubernetes!
